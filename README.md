### About Me 👋

😄 Hi, I'm Stella.

- I focus on machine learning through a mathematical lens — combining modeling, optimization concepts, and statistical reasoning to build robust AI systems.

My background includes:
- Mathematical modeling
- Applied machine learning & deep learning
- Optimization and probabilistic modeling (in progress)
- End-to-end system implementation

- I’m particularly interested in representation learning and technically grounded AI systems.
